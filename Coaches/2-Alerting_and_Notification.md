## Happy Path

* Edit the existing CreateRating function and put userNotes through either:
    * Text Analytics Cognitive Services API calls
    * [TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/index.html#) library using Python functions
* Create Custom Telemetry to write to the same App Insights instance as the function whenever thereâ€™s a bad review
* Use the Log Alerts feature for Application Insights to generate an alert and email when the threshold is reached
